## Knowledge for a sustainable future

NORSUS apply and develop knowledge and methods to understand and implement sustainable solutions in society. 

We work with many of Norway’s most innovative and future-oriented enterprises in a number of areas and develop new methods that match the needs of our project partners.

Together with a wide range of public and private clients, we undertake projects locally, nationally and internationally to enhance environmental performance, often also generating economic benefits.

We are passionate about better use of resources, from the product to the societal level. We therefore work with environmental and resource efficiency through a life cycle approach (LCA). 

For more than 30 years (and long before the term was widely known) we have worked with the circular economy. 

We are among Europe’s leading research communities in LCA.
